**Dependencies:**
- random
- NumPy
- math
- matplotlib
- tabulate

**Output:**
- Average waiting time
- Number of customers that had to wait
- The total time of the simulation
- The probability that a customer will have to wait
- Utilization of ATMs
- Maximum number in the queue
- Average time in the system
- Histogram for waiting time
- Event Calendar for the first 15 customers
