# TwoATMs_Simulation
A simple Python program that performs a number of simulations in order to determine whether it is more effective to use 1 or 2 ATM tellers in a bank.
The output:
1. Average waiting time
2. Number of customers that had to wait
3. The total time of the simulation
4. The probability that a customer will have to wait
5. Utilization of ATMs
6. Maximum number in the queue
7. Average time in the system
8. Histogram for waiting time 
9. Event Calendar for the first 15 customers
